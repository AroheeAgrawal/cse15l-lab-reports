## Part 2
### Something interesting that I learned about during the secodn half of the quarter was `vim`. I didn't know before that there are text editors that are built into `Linux`. I found this really useful because it means that one does not need to use a platform such as VSCode to view and edit files and everything can be done from the terminal. I also thought it was really cool that there were so many keyboard shortcuts for `vim`. Specifically I thought the fact that one can search and select all of the iterations of s certain phrase was really useful for editing purposes.
